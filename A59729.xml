            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

No Officer may exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute any Writ, Order, or Warrant on the Lords day, or any day of Humiliation, or thankſgiving (but in caſe of Treaſon, Felony, breach of Peace, and profaining of the day.) 3.

               <p>As to the Power and Office of theſe Officers; <note place="margin">His Power and Office.</note> theſe things are to be known.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are to receive ſuch Priſoners as are duly ſent, or offered to them, and all that are ſent by a Juſtice of peace Warrant, they muſt receive. If any Officer arreſt a man upon ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition of Felony, and carry him to the Gao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, he muſt receive him without a Juſtice Warrant; and if any man that is no Officer, take a Fellon doing the Fellony, and bring him to the Gaoler; it ſeemes alſo that in this caſe, he is to receive him alſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His duty and charge is, to look well to
<pb facs="tcp:47585:17"/> the Priſoners that are in his cuſtody; for if he ſuffer any of them to eſcape, he will be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for it: If they be Priſoners for debt, and he let them eſcape voluntarily, or negligently, he muſt pay to the Creditor his debt. If they be in for Fllony, and the Keeper ſuffer them willfully to eſcape, he is a Fellon, if negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently he is finable: and ſo he is for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcapes of leſſer Offenders.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It hath been held by ſome Judges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that a Gaoler may juſtifie the putting of Bolts upon the Legs of any Priſoners com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Keepers they are to ſee, that their Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have neceſſary proviſion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For this the Law doth give an action of debt to the Gaoler, againſt his Priſoner; nor can the Priſoner in this action, be ſuffered to wage his law.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They are to take care, that ſuch Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as are in their cuſtody in execution for debt, be kept in ſtrait cuſtody, and have not too much liberty: for by this means, they will be forced the ſooner to pay their debts.</p>
               <p n="7">7. They may not compell, or procure their Priſoners to become approveres, that is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of others; for this is Fellony.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If a Priſoner of debt get away from a Gaoler againſt his will, he may follow him and take him again, and bring him to, and put him in, the Gaole again. And ſo he may any Priſoner that is in for any Crime or offence. But if a Keeper doe voluntarily deliver a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner of debt, there he cannot retake him &amp; put him in Priſon again, for he is diſcharged of
<pb facs="tcp:47585:17"/> his impriſonment, and the Gaoler muſt ſatisfie the debt. <hi>Coo.</hi> 9. 87. <hi>Dier.</hi> 249. <hi>Stat.</hi> 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Stat</hi> 1, 7, 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 14 <hi>Ed</hi> 3. <hi>Stat.</hi> 1, 10. <hi>Br. Faux Impr.</hi> 24. 27.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:47585:18"/> (whoſe Offices we intend to ſpeak of) are ſaid to be Officers of the Common-wealth, appointed for the maintenance of the Peace thereof, and to be attendant to Court-Leetes, Juſtices of Peace and Coroners, for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their Warrants within their Precinct and Liberty: And Maſter <hi>Lamberd</hi> ſaith the name of a <hi>Conſtable</hi> in a Hundred or Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe doth mean, that he is an Officer that did ſupport the Kings Majeſty in the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his Peace, within the Precinct of his Hundred or Franchiſe: And of theſe <hi>Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> there are now ſaid to be two ſorts I he firſt ſort are the <hi>high-Constables,</hi> which are for the whole Hundred, Lathe, Rape or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentake, the which doe comprehend many Pariſhes, Tythings and Villages; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe Officers, in reſpect of Place, have a more large command than <hi>petty-Conſtables</hi> have. Theſe Officers were ordained by the Statute of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> which doth appoint (amongſt other things) That for the better keeping of the peace, <hi>two-Conſtables</hi> in every Hundred or Franchiſe ſhall make the view of Armour; and they are called <hi>high-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables,</hi> in compariſon of the <hi>Constables</hi> or <hi>pety-Constables,</hi> that be in the Towns or Pariſhes within their Hundreds or Franchiſes, whoſe duty is likewiſe to maintain the Peace, within the ſeverall limits of their Townes or Pariſhes. And of theſe <hi>high Constables</hi> there were to be, and were anciently, two in every Hundred, but at this day there is but one in many Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds. The other ſort of <hi>Conſtables,</hi> are the <hi>petty-Constables,</hi> or the <hi>under-Conſtables,</hi> who
<pb facs="tcp:47585:18"/> are only for ſome part, as for a Town, Pariſh, Village, Tything or Hamlet within the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred (for every hundred hath his <hi>high-Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and every ſeverall Tything within the Hundred hath his <hi>petty-Conſtable, Tythin-man,</hi> or the like within it,) ſo that the Command of the <hi>petty-Conſtable</hi> is only in one part of the Precinct of the <hi>high-Conſtable,</hi> but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for his Authority, by the ancient Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Lawes; his Office (as far as his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct doth extend) is the ſame with the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the <hi>high-Conſtable</hi> over the whole Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. The <hi>Tything-man, Borſholder, Borrow-Head or Head-Borrow, Third-Borow</hi> and <hi>Chiefe-Pleadge,</hi> or by whatſoever names they be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in any Townes, Pariſhes, Tythings, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, Hamlets or other places, and their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices are in effect, in moſt places, but one and the ſame: For in ſome Counties this Officer is called by one name, and in other Counties by another name, as in <hi>Kent</hi> he is called <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſholder;</hi> in <hi>Warwick-ſhire Third-Borow,</hi> and in other places he is called <hi>Conſtable,</hi> and in ſome places he is called <hi>Tything-man;</hi> for he that is called and ſworn the <hi>Tything-man</hi> of any Place, is (in effect) the <hi>Conſtable</hi> of the Place: and therefore in ſuch places, for the moſt part, there is no other Officer called or ſworn by the name of a <hi>Conſtable;</hi> for, as <hi>petty-Conſtables</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the beginging of the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, were deviſed in Towns and Pariſhes for the aid of the <hi>Conſtables</hi> of the Hundred, ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward <hi>Borſholders,</hi> and ſuch like, were uſed as <hi>petty-Conſtables</hi> within their own Tythings and Burrowes. But if it be ſo (as it is in ſome
<pb facs="tcp:47585:19"/> few places) that there is one <hi>Conſtable</hi> for the Common-wealth, and there is alſo one or more <hi>Tything-men,</hi> and the <hi>Constable</hi> doth exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute all the Office, and the <hi>Tything-men</hi> are but as attendants on him, and ſeem to have but little power; or it be as in ſome places, the <hi>Tything-man</hi> is to doe ſervice to the Lord of the Mannor, rather than to the Common-wealth, and he is a cuſtomary <hi>Tything-man</hi> choſen at the Lords Court. Or if it be ſo that there are two or more <hi>Tything-men,</hi> and one of them is for the Common-wealth, to execute the Office of <hi>Conſtable,</hi> and is alwayes choſen at the Leet, and this <hi>Tythingman,</hi> time out of minde, hath been uſed to doe nothing about the Office of the <hi>Conſtable,</hi> but to doe other things; in theſe Caſes the cuſtome of the place may and muſt be continued, and ſuch <hi>Tything-men</hi> ſhall not be compelled to doe more than by cuſtome they have uſed to doe: Howbeit otherwiſe, and in all other places, all theſe Officers are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended within this word <hi>Conſtable,</hi> and all theſe Offices are contained within this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>

                  <p>THe <hi>High-Conſtables</hi> are and may be choſen and made, either by the Juſtices of the Peace, at their quarter Seſſions, or at
<pb facs="tcp:47585:19"/> the Leet, and there, eyther by the Steward of the Leet himſelf, or by the preſentment of the grand-Inqueſt, in the Leet, as the courſe and cuſtome of the place is: And theſe were heretofore choſen and ſworn in the Sheriffes turn. The <hi>Petty-Conſtables</hi> are and may moſt properly be choſen by the Steward of the Leet himſelf, or the Preſentment of the Inqueſt in the Leet; But theſe alſo are choſen by the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices <note place="margin">

The perſon choſen, muſt be a Lay, and not a Clergy-perſon, for all Clergy-men are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from this ſervice, as they are from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance at the Leet; and therefore if any ſuch perſon ſhall be choſen to this Office, he may get himſelf diſcharged by a Writ; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſee afterwards. 2. The party choſen, as he muſt be a lay perſon, ſo he muſt be a lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, not a lay-woman, and therefore a wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow or maid, albeit ſhe keep Houſe of her ſelf, and dwell in a Houſe whoſe owner hath been uſed to ſerve in this Office, is not to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to this Office, no more than ſhe is to doe ſuit to the Leet. 3. The party choſen, as he muſt be a man, ſo he muſt be <hi>idoneus homo, i. e.</hi> a fit man, &amp; that firſt for his knowledge, that he doth in ſome good meaſure underſtand what he doth and ought to doe. And therefore a man that is <hi>non compos mentis,</hi> as an Ideot or mad man, an Infant, or the like, cannot be a fit man. 2. He muſt be fit for his honeſty, that he may be likely to execute his Office truely without ill affection or partiality, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſeems a ſcandalous liver, a malicious and contentious man cannot be a fit man. 3. He muſt be fit for his abilite of Body and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. And therefore an old, weak, ſick, or otherwiſe, impotent man; or a poor needy man that lives only by his labour, cannot be a
<pb facs="tcp:47585:20"/> fit man. It was therefore by ſpeciall directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the King, in <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1630. given in charge, that the <hi>Conſtables</hi> in all pariſhes ſhould be choſen of the able ſort of pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and that the Office ſhould not be put upon the poorer ſort, the which if it were well obſerved, would no doubt much further the execution of Juſtice through the Nation. And if becauſe the common courſe is every where to put theſe Offices upon the meaner ſort of men, the more able ſort doe think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thereby exempted, they are therein much deceived; for it is not much to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but that all perſons that are bound to doe ſuit in the Leet, are bound to ſerve in theſe Offices, that are after a ſort appendant to the Leet; and therefore if any ſuch perſon be called and choſen thereunto, he muſt and will be compelled to execute the ſame: Howbeit it is deemed an unfit and indiſcreet part to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect any to theſe Offices, that in reſpect of their o her Offices, Callings or Profeſſions, are preſumed to have ſo much other imployment that they have not leiſure to attend upon this ſo much as is required. And hence it is that the Juſtice of Peace, Sheriffs, Lawyers, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnies, and ſuch like Perſons, are ſeldome or never choſen to theſe Offices; For if any Steward or J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>y in a Leet ſhould be ſo indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet as to cho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e any ſuch men to theſe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Juſtices of Peace, upon complaint to them hereof, will no doubt be ſo diſcreet as to diſcharge them again, and elect others in their place; for he cannot be fit for that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which he hath no leiſure to wait and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb facs="tcp:47585:21"/> upon: But otherwiſe it is not only law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but convenient alſo, that theſe Officers be choſen, in all places, of the abler ſort of men. And therefore it hath been of late reſolved by the Judges, That if a man had made himſelf one of the Kings ſervants extraordinary, that this would not exempt him from the execution of this office, but he muſt have been made <hi>Conſtable</hi> notwithſtanding. 4. An Infant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the age of twenty one yeers may not of right bee compelled to ſerve in theſe offices. And yet if ſuch a one be choſen and ſworn, it ſeemes he may execute the office as another man may doe: And therefore if a young man of the age of twenty yeers, or thereabouts (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if he be ſuch a one as hath the growth wiſdome, and courage of an elder man, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it falleth out) be choſen to this office, he ſhall doe well to take it upon him and execute it. An old man alſo aged ſixty, or thereabouts, (eſpecially if his ſtrength of body and minde be not much abated) may be compelled to ſerve in theſe offices. 5. If a man live within one Hundred or Tything, and have land only within another Hundred or Tything, he may not be choſen to ſerve in this office in the place where his land is; for if he have no Houſe upon his Land, it ſeems neither he nor his Tenant is bound to ſerve in theſe offices at all, in reſpect of the Land<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> For men are bound to ſerve in theſe offices in reſpect of their Perſons and Reſiancy, and not in reſpect of their Land: But if he have a houſe upon his land, and a Tenant dwelling in it, and he be a ſufficient man and able to ſerve the office,
<pb facs="tcp:47585:21"/> he may be choſen and made to ſerve it, but not the Land-lord, for perhaps he may be choſen to this or ſome other office in the place where he dwells, and a man can doe ſervice with his body but in one place at one time. And yet if the Caſe be ſo that a man hath two ſeverall Houſes in two ſeverall precincts, and within ſeverall Leets, and he doe live ſometimes at the one houſe and ſometimes at the other houſe, in this caſe he may perhaps be made an Officer at either of the Leets, within either of the places, if he be there dwelling at the time when the Leet is kept; for a man may doe corporall ſervice at two places, at ſeverall times. But if two Tythings be within one Leet, and one man hath houſes in both the Tythings, in this caſe it ſeemeth doubtfull, whether albeit he doe live in the one Tything, he may not be compelled to ſerve in this Office for his Houſe in the other Tything, eſpecially if the Tythings be neer, and he keep no Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in his Houſe fit to undergoe the Office when it ſhall come to his turn; wherein, as in all other ſuch like caſes a due conſideration muſt be had of all circumſtances.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By that which hath been ſaid it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, then how unreaſonable a thing it is, that theſe Offices ſhould follow the Houſes, or that two or three in a Tything, and no more, ſhould alwaies execute the ſame (as in ſome places hath been uſed) and therefore it hath <note place="margin">

                  <p n="4">4. If there be a man unfit, for any of the
<pb facs="tcp:47585:22"/> cauſes aforeſaid, choſen and appointed to this Office in a Leet, either by the Stewards no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, or by the Preſentment of the Jury, or by one Juſtice of Peace, only, out of Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſuch a man may be removed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged again, by Order of the Juſtices of Peace, at their Seſſions, and another man more fit may be by them, then and there, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and ſworn in his room that is ſo remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But if the man elected and made <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable</hi> in a Leet, be a fit man, the Juſtices of the Peace may not remove him and appoint another: And ſo it hath been agreed by the Judges. And yet if the Juſtices of the Peace ſhall remove ſuch a man choſen in a Leet, that is a fit man, it ſeems there is no remedy but by complaint to the Lord cheif Juſtices, or the Judges of the Circuit, &amp;c. If the <hi>Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> be choſen by the Jury in a Leet, and the man choſen be unfit, and the Steward of the Leet doth perceive it; in this caſe it ſeemes the Steward himſelf may elect and ſwear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man, more fit, and refuſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge him that is ſo choſen by the Jury. And it is held alſo; That in default of the Leet, or otherwiſe, where there ſhall be juſt cauſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Juſtice of Peace, <hi>ex officio,</hi> may remove the old <hi>Conſtable</hi> and chooſe and ſwear a new one; and that for this purpoſe he may ſend forth his Warrant to require ſuch Perſon to come in and take his Oath before ſuch Juſtice of the Peace.

And if he be choſen at the Seſſions, or by one Juſtice of Peace out of Seſſions, and he refuſe to take his oath, he <note place="margin">

And if one man be choſen an Officer, and he deſire to have a Deputy, and to have him ſworn and allowed, if the Deputy be ſufficient, and be allowed and ſworn, in this caſe the Deputy, and not the other, is the Officer; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Duputy muſt anſwer for himſelf, and his doings, and not the other for him. But the making of a Deputy in this caſe, is rather by tolleration than by Law, and ſo hath it been delivered by the Judges.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:47585:28"/> day, the one being his Ancient and firſt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and the other his later made Office; his firſt Office began thus. By the ancient Lawes of this Nation (before the comming in of King <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror) it was ordained for the more ſure keeping of the Peace, and for the better repreſſing of Theeves and Robbers, That all free born men ſhould caſt themſelves into ſeverall Companies, by ten in each Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and that every of thoſe ten men of the Company ſhould be ſurety and pledge for the forth-coming of his fellowes; ſo that if any harm were done by any of theſe ten againſt the Peace, then the reſt of the ten ſhould be amerced, if he of their Company that did the harm ſhould flie and were not forth-coming, to anſwer to that wherewith he ſhould be charged; and for this cauſe theſe Companies be yet in ſome places of <hi>England</hi> called <hi>Boroes,</hi> of the word <hi>Borhes,</hi> Pledges or Sureties; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit in the Weſtern parts of this Nation they be commonly named <hi>Tythings,</hi> becauſe they contain the number of ten men, with their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; and even as ten times ten doe make an hundred, ſo becauſe it was then alſo appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ten of theſe Companies ſhould at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times meet together for the matters of greater weight, therefore that generall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly or Court was, and yet is, called a <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</hi> And it was then alſo ordained, That if any man were of ſo evill credit that he could not get himſelf to be received into one of theſe <hi>Tythings</hi> or <hi>Boroes,</hi> then he ſhould be ſhut up in priſon, as a man unworthy to live at liberty amongſt men abroad; and whereas every of
<pb facs="tcp:47585:28"/> theſe <hi>Tythings</hi> or <hi>Boroes</hi> did uſe to make choice of one man amongſt themſelves to ſpeak and to doe in the name of them all; he was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſome places called the <hi>Tything-man,</hi> in other places the <hi>Boroes-Elder,</hi> now called <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſholder</hi> in ſome places, in other places the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe-Head</hi> or <hi>Head-Borow,</hi> and in ſome other places the <hi>Chief-Pledg,</hi> which laſt name doth expound the other three that are next before it; For <hi>Head</hi> or <hi>Elder</hi> of the <hi>Boroes,</hi> and <hi>Chief</hi> of the <hi>Pledges</hi> are all one, and in ſome Shires where every <hi>Third-Borow</hi> hath a <hi>Conſtable,</hi> there the Officers of the other two are called <hi>Third-Borowes.</hi> Moreover in theſe <hi>Tythings</hi> or <hi>Boroes,</hi> ſundry good orders were obſerved, and amongſt others: Firſt, That every man of the age of twelve yeers ſhould be ſworn to the King. Then that no man ſhould be ſuffered to dwell in any Town or place unleſſe he were alſo received into ſome Suretyſhip and <hi>Pledge</hi> as is aforeſaid: And that if any of theſe Pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were impriſoned for his offence, then he ought not to be delivered without the aſſent of the reſt of his Pledges.

Thirdly, Some <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Numb. </seg>3</label> part of their Offices are derived from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Common-Law, and other parts from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Acts of Parliament newly made, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are further enabled or charged than they were before by the Common-Law.

                     <note place="margin">What every man may doe in the Conſtables Office.</note> may much more doe: And therefore a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable</hi> may without doubt part Affrayors, or keep them aſunder in a Room of his own or of another mans houſe, for a time, to prevent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.

In all caſes, where any Warrant is ſent from any Juſtice of Peace, to any of theſe Officers, touching any matter whatſoever, concerning the Office of the Juſtice of Peace; it ſeems he is bound to execute it: And therefore it ſeems, that in all caſes where any Statute doth enable a Juſtice of Peace to apprehend any Perſon to be brought before him, or to commit any perſon to the Gaol, as in the caſes of thoſe that keep unlawfull Games in their houſes, or haunt ſuch houſes, or in the caſe of men that ſhoot in, or carry Gunns, or the like; That in all theſe caſes the Juſtices of Peace are to command theſe Officers, and they are to obey them.
<pb facs="tcp:47585:32"/> 2. Theſe Officers muſt with all reſpect, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <note place="margin">

P.</hi> 291.</note> the Warrants of the Juſtice of Peace: for if any Warrant be ſent from a Juſtice of Peace, to any one of theſe Officers, and he ſhall ſhew any neglect or contempt of it, as by caſting it into the dyrt, &amp;c. or doe not with all care, ſecrecy and diligence exeecute the ſame; theſe are miſdemeanors puniſhable: and for either of theſe miſdemeanors, the party offending may either be bound to the good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior, or be Indicted and fined. And by the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. there is a ſpeciall charge laid upon the officers, within the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Wales,</hi> That they be carefull to execute the Warrants of the Juſtices of the Peace there. 3. Let him then conſider what he hath to doe: For howſoever this be true that he is not bound to, nor may he diſpute the authority of the Juſtice of Peace, and whether his Warrant be lawfull or not. For if the Juſtice miſtake, and goe beyond his authority in the manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in a thing, wherein for the matter he hath Conuſance; As if he ſend a Warrant to him to arreſt any man for the Peace or good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, without any cauſe; or to take a man for a Fellony when none is done; yet in theſe and ſuch like caſes the Officer is bound to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it, and he ſhall be excuſed therein. But if the thing whereabout the Warrant is, be ſuch a matter as is out of the juriſdiction of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of Peace, and wherein he is no judg; As if he ſend his Warrant to the <hi>Conſtable,</hi> to levy of the goods of <hi>J. S.</hi> 10. l. Debt, which he doth owe to him, or owe to another, and all this appeareth upon the Warrant it ſelf;
<pb facs="tcp:47585:33"/> That in this and ſuch like caſes, it is agreed, That the Officer may refuſe to execute it, and may (not without danger) obey it. And truly to me it ſeems neceſſary we diſtinguiſh again between things apparent, and things conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and between leſſer and more notorious miſtakes: and it is reaſonable to affirm, that if the miſtake and error of the Juſtice of Peace be ſet down in the Warrant and be groſſe and notorious; As if he ſend a Warrant to levy of a man 10. l. becauſe he hath ſworn an Oath; Or ſend his Warrant to one of theſe Officers, to command him to ſell the one half of the Goods of a man convict before him for ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 6. Oaths, when perhaps theſe Goods may be worth 100. l. or he ſend a verball War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant only, to one that is abſent and out of his preſence; or ſend his Warrant to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable</hi> of the Pariſh of <hi>Dale,</hi> as <hi>Conſtable</hi> of <hi>Dale,</hi> to levy a forfeiture upon an offender, for an offence in <hi>Sale,</hi> out of his Precinct, or ſend his Warrant to a <hi>Constable,</hi> to carry <hi>J. S.</hi> to Gaol, becauſe he will not pay him a Debt he doth owe him; That in theſe and ſuch like caſes, the <hi>Constable</hi> is not bound to obey him, or execute it; nor ſhall he be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed if he doe it. But if the Juſtice of Peace, where he hath power to ſend a man to Priſon after ten dayes, give Warrant to ſend him to priſon before the ten dayes be out: Or if by an Act of Parliament, he is directed to ſend a Warrant under his hand and ſeal, ſend it only under his hand, or <hi>contra:</hi> And where he is to ſend it to the <hi>Conſtables</hi> and <hi>Church-War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> he ſend is to the <hi>Conſtables</hi> or <hi>Church-wardens;</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:47585:33"/> or on the other ſide, and in ſuch like petit miſtakes, it ſeems reaſonable to me the Officer ſhould be excuſed, if he doe exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it; for it is a very hard thing to require of him an exact knowledge of the many Acts of Parliament, ſo variouſly and incertainly pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned herein, as belong to his Office; and he is in danger to be puniſhed if he doe not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Juſtice of Peace Warrants. So that my adviſe herein to the Officer is, to conſider well of the Warrant; and if he finde the thing to be done, nothing but what is ordinary, and hath been uſed to be done by theſe Officers, he is to doe it: but if it be to doe any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſuall, new, ſtrange, and extraordinary, to be well adviſed e're he doe it. <hi>Coo.</hi> 10. 76. 6. 54. 14 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 16. <hi>Broo. F. Impr.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>And if a Juſtice of Peace ſend a generall Warrant to an Officer, to carry <hi>J. S.</hi> to Gaol, or to bring him before him, and expreſs no cauſe why, it ſeems to me reaſonable in both theſe caſes, the Officer in the doing hereof is excuſable. But if the Juſtice have not good cauſe for it, he may be ſued for it: And ſo perhaps he may be, though he have cauſe for the not expreſſing of it within his Warrant.</p>
                  <p>If this Officer doe arreſt any man under <note place="margin">Warrant.</note> pretence of a Warrant, let him be ſure he have the Warrant firſt. For if the Officer firſt arreſt, and bring the man to the Juſtice, and then get a Warrant to doe it, this will not make the arreſt lawfull. 5. A Warrant of a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of Peace by word of mouth, is as good in ſome Caſes as a Warrant by writing: As if a Ryot, or other breach of the Peace, be in

But in other Caſes he cannot give warrant to an Officer that is abſent and out of his preſence; and if he ſend a Warrant by Meſſage only to an Officer to arreſt a man and carry him to Gaole, the Conſtable may refuſe to doe it. 6. If any Warrant come from a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of Peace to one of theſe Officers, to doe a thing, the Officer himſelf muſt doe it, and he cannot by word or writing make a Deputy, or <note place="margin">Deputy.</note> command another to doe it, but he may call what ayde he will. 7. In the execution of theſe Warrants, he is to take great care that he follow the contents of his Warrant, and not to exceed it, for that may be dangerous. And yet this muſt be underſtood, that when any thing is commanded, all that doth neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the doing of that thing, and without which it cannot be done, is commanded alſo; and therefore all that, and ſo much, may be done, albeit it be not ſet down in expreſs words in the Warrant.

The Officer muſt take care that he take the very party named in the Warrant, and not another; for if a Warrant be intended againſt <hi>J. S.</hi> (who is the Delinquent) but it be ſent againſt <hi>J. D.</hi> another man; in this Caſe the Officer cannot arreſt <hi>J. S.</hi> but muſt arreſt <hi>J. D.</hi> 11. If the Proſecutor for the Peace or good Behaviour, after the Warrant ſent, agree, yet the Officer muſt execute his Warrant.</p>
                  <p>18. When any one of theſe Officers hath <label type="milestone">

And therefore he is to call his Neighbours, or as many as will come, and with them, or without them, if they refuſe make an equall Rate ſufficient to pay all his neceſſary charges and expences in the doing of his Office; and it will be good to get a Juſtice hand to it, if he can: and if any refuſe to pay it, let him complain to the Juſtice of Peace, who will either binde him that refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to the Quarter-Seſſions, or finde ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to bring him to reaſon.

And of this Warrants exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and of his proceedings upon it, the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer muſt give an account to the Juſtices of the Peace at their next Seſſions of the Peace. And if the party doth yeeld to goe to a Juſtice of Peace to give Surety, according to the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but will not goe to the ſame Juſtice that made the Warrant, but to ſome other Juſtice he doth name; herein the Officer may, if he pleaſe, ſuffer him to have his will, howbeit in this caſe the Law doth give the election to the Officer, and he may bring the party before what Juſtice of Peace he pleaſe: And yet if the Warrant be to bring the party before the ſame Juſtice of Peace that made it: In this caſe the Officer muſt bring him before the ſame Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and cannot bring him before any other. And if the party being before the Juſtice of Peace, refuſe to give Surety according to the Warrant, and the Warrant have words of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to the Officer, to carry him to the Gaol (as moſt commonly every Warrant hath) then <note place="margin">Carrying to Gaole.</note> may the Officer carry him to priſon without any new Warrant from the ſame or any other Juſtice of Peace ſo to doe.

And by this <hi>Superſedeas</hi> the Officer is diſcharged of any duty touching the Warrant of the Juſtice of Peace directed to him: But let the Officer ſee that he keep his <hi>Superſedeas</hi> ſafe for his diſcharge, if he be queſtioned for not ſerving the Warrant. And it is not amiſs for him to give notice of the ſame to the Juſtice of Peace from whom he received the commandement of ſervice, that thereby he may ſee the cauſe why the ſame was not done.

IF an Inne-keeper, &amp;c. refuſe to receive a Traveller when his houſe is not full, and having no good reaſon for it, this Officer may compell the Inne-keeper to receive him: But how he may compel him is doubted: For it ſeems all he can doe, is to cauſe him to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted at the Seſſions, or to be ſuppreſſed for it. 2. If any perſon without lawfull licence take upon him (except it be at Fair times only) to keep a common Ale-houſe or Tipling-houſe, or uſe commonly ſelling of Ale, Beer, Cider, or Perry, he ſhall forfeit for every ſuch offence twenty ſhillings, to the uſe of the Poor of the place (the offence being viewed by one Juſtice of Peace, or confeſſed by the party, or proved by one witneſs before him:) And this forfeiture may be, or is to be levyed by the Conſtable or Church-Wardens of the place, by Warrant from a Juſtice of Peace, &amp;c.

And if he pay not the monie within three dayes after the diſtreſs taken, they muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and ſell the ſame Goods, and keep up the ſame monie; and if there be any over-plus, they muſt render the ſame to the partie. And if the partie ſhall not have Goods, &amp;c. or ſhall not pay the ſame within ſix dayes after conviction, then the Juſtices of Peace, &amp;c. may commit the offendor to any of theſe Officers to be openly whipped, according to the diſcretion of the Juſtices of Peace.

And for the forfeitures levyed by others upon the Officers, they that levy the ſame ſhall be accountable therefore. And if any man be drunk, and thereof convict, he is to forfeit five ſhillings for the ſame, which he is to pay within a week after the conviction to the Church-wardens, to the uſe of the poor of the place, to be levyed (on the neglect or refuſall of the party to pay it) by Warrant from the Court, Judge, or Juſtices, before whom the ſame conviction was, upon the offendors Goods. And this Warrant may be made to the Conſtables or Church-Wardens. And if the party be not able to pay it, then he is, by Warrant from the Juſtice of Peace, to be ſet in the Stocks, and there to ſit ſix houres. And for the ſecond offence, he is to be bound to the good Behaviour.

Theſe now by the new Ordinance of the ninth of <hi>February</hi> 1647. where they have been uſed to be, are to be choſen every year on the
<pb facs="tcp:47585:75"/> Monday or Tueſday in the Eaſter week, by the major part of the Pariſh, at a publique meeting; And they may chooſe one, two, three, or four, as they pleaſe. And if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh doe omit this Election, it loſeth fourty ſhillings to the uſe of the Poor of the Pariſh. This choice alſo muſt be allowed under the Hands and Seals of two of the next Juſtices of Peace. And being thus choſen, they are to continue in their Office but one year, and no longer, except there be a cuſtom for longer time, and except they be choſen again in the ſame manner at the years end, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they are to be changed every year. And in caſe of miſcarriage in their office, they are to be put out, and others choſen within the year. And albeit there be a Cuſtom within the Pariſh, that the Church-wardens ſhall continue in their Office by the ſpace of one year, two years, or more, (as in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there is) yet in caſe of miſdemeanor found in them, about the execution of their Office, the Pariſhioners may at any time proceed to a new election of new, and remove the old Church-wardens; for there is no other remedy againſt this evil. In the choiſe of theſe Officers care muſt be had, as in the choiſe of Conſtables, that there be none but honeſt and able men choſen to the Office.</p>
               <p>For the diſcovery of the Office and duty <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Numb.</hi> 2.</note> of theſe Officers, theſe things are to be <note place="margin">Their Office and Duty.</note> known. 1. That for ſome things belonging to their Office, they have a power and Office therein by the ancient Common Law: And
<pb facs="tcp:47585:75"/> for other things belonging to their Office, they have a Power and Duty therein, by certain Acts of Parliament newly made, by which their Office is enlarged. And for this laſt alſo, ſome things hereof doe concern the Church and Church matters. Other things doe concern other matters. Some things alſo they may doe <hi>Ex Officio,</hi> and without any warrant from others. Other things they may doe only by warrant from others. We ſhall ſpeak firſt to the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Church.</p>
               <p>2. By the ancient Common Law, the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Numb. </seg>1</label> Office of the Church-wardens doth lye in <note place="margin">In providing and keeping the Church Goods.</note> theſe things. 1. They are to ſee to, and preſerve the Goods of the Church <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Books, Communion Cups, Linnen Cloaths, and other decent Ornaments and Furniture of the Church which they doe finde there, when they enter into their Office. And if there be any lack in theſe things, they are to ſee and provide them, and being provided, preſerve and keep them alſo. And for this purpoſe (in favour of the Church) the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to enable them herein, the Law doth make of them a kinde of Corporation <hi>(viz.)</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Corporation.</note> perſons enabled by that name to take move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Goods or Chattels, and to ſue and to be ſued at Law concerning ſuch Goods, for the uſe and profit of their Pariſh. For the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the Goods of the Church is in them, and they are by that name enabled to take them, and to be ſued for them, for the uſe and profit of the Pariſh. And therefore theſe Officers may have and enjoy Goods to the uſe
<pb facs="tcp:47585:76"/> of the Church. And a Man may well, in his life time, or by his laſt Will, give or grant monie or other movable things to the Church-wardens, or to the Pariſhioners of a Pariſh, for the Reparations of a Church, or for the buying of Books, Communion Cups; Linnen Cloaths, or other decent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments or Furniture for the Church. And this kinde of Gift is ſo much favored in Law, that it is not needfull therein to have any Writing or words at all. For if a man doe but buy a Bell, and hang it up in the Steeple; or make a Pew, and ſet it up in the Church, and doe make no words or writing hereof; by this the Bell and the Pew are ſo dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and given to the Church, that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">Actions by, or againſt them.</note> that did owe them, can never have them again. And if any Goods or Chattels be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to the Church, and be kept from it, the Church-wardens may by Suit recover it in a Court of Equity. But they can have no Action by the Common Law, to recover any ſuch thing given, of the which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had the poſſeſſion: But if the Church-wardens be once poſſeſſed of any Goods or Ornaments belonging to the Church, and afterwards the ſame things be taken from them; they ſhall have the ſame remedie for theſe things, as other men have for the Goods taken from them; And therefore if ſuch Goods be ſtollen, the Church-wardens may have an Appeal of Robbery againſt the taker of them. And if they be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe taken away or abuſed, as if a Bell be broken, or the like, the Church-wardens
<pb facs="tcp:47585:76"/> may have an Action againſt him that doth it, albeit he be the Parſon or Vicar himſelf. And in this Action they ſhall recover dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages to the uſe and benefit of the Pariſh, and not to their own uſe. And yet theſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers have no ſuch property in the Goods of the Pariſh, as thereby to have power to give, ſell, releaſe, hurt, or impair them; for they are Officers truſted for the behalf of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; and therefore have no power in the Goods of the Pariſh, but for the good and profit of the Pariſh. And therefore if they ſhall ſo doe, or otherwiſe unprofitably waſte or miſ-imploy the Goods of the Pariſh, the Pariſhioners may remove him, and chooſe another, although it be before his year be expired. Alſo it ſeems the party that doth ſteal or take away any Goods belonging to the Church, may be puniſhed for it, as for a Sacrilegious offence. And if theſe Church-wardens, from whom the Goods be taken, dye, or be out of their Office; their ſucceſſors (as ſome think) may ſue for and recover them, or the damages for them: Or if theſe Church-wardens may not, the old Church-wardens may ſue for, and recover the ſame. And if anything have been uſed time out of minde, to be paid towards the Church, and it be now withheld, the Church-wardens may ſue for the ſame in a Court of Equity. But as touching any Eſtate of Lands, or the profits of any Lands, the Church-wardens are not to meddle at all; inſomuch, That if the Walls, Windows, or Dores of the Church be broken down, or the Trees in the
<pb facs="tcp:47585:77"/> Church-yard cut down, or the Graſs thereof be eaten up; the Parſon or Vicar, nor the Church-wardems ſhall have an Action for it; for they are a Corporation onely as to moveable Goods. And therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take Eſtates of Lands to them, by name of Church-wardens only, in Fee-ſimple, for life or years, to the uſe of the Church. And if a Feoffment be made of any Land to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to the uſe of Pariſhoners, or to the uſe of the Church-wardens of a Pariſh: this is a voyd uſe in Law, and they ſhall take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by this conveyance. 37 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 30. 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 12. 8 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>F.

               <p>2. Theſe Officers are bound by the very <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Numb. </seg>4</label> common Law, to take care, and look to the <note place="margin">In making of Reparations.</note> Body of the Church and the Tower, that the ſame be ſufficiently repaired, kept and maintained; and that if any of the neceſſary Ornaments therein appointed for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, he decayed, that they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired again; for there muſt be alwayes in a readineſs, all things neceſſary to the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word and Adminiſtration of the Sacraments. And they are to ſee that their Bells be in caſe, and fit for uſe. But if the Chancel, (the which in moſt, if not in all places, is to be repaired by the Parſon) or any Iſle in the Church, the which any man doth claim by preſcription to himſelf, or his houſe in particulat be in decay, the Church-wardens are not bound to repaire this. And now by the new Ordinance of
<pb facs="tcp:47585:77"/> Parliament they may raiſe money, not to build a new Church quite down, nor to repaire a Cathedral or Collegiate Church, but they may raiſe money to maintain or repaire a Parochiall Church, provide Books, Bread and Wine for the Sacrament, repaire <note place="margin">Bread and Wine.</note> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ncloſures of the Church yard, or bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, and to all other things that doe belong to their Office. And further, they muſt make ſuch reparations as any Juſtice of Peace ſhall under his Hand and Seal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point about any part of the Church.</p>
               <p>3. Theſe Officers (as it ſeems) by the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Numb. </seg>5</label> Common Law are to order the Seats in the <note place="margin">In dispoſing of Seats.</note> Church, and to appoint every man and woman where they ſhall ſit. And yet if any man have an Iſle, or a ſeat in an Iſle, or by-place out of the body of the Church, unto which he may make a right by preſcription, as that which time out of minde hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed or appertained unto his houſe; in this caſe, neither the Church wardens nor any other can turn him out of it. And albeit one may not preſcribe to have a Seat in the body of the Church, as belonging to his houſe, yet if the caſe be ſo, that a man hath time out of minde had ſuch a Seat or Seat-place in the body of a Church as appertaining to his houſe; in this caſe the Church wardens ought not without very good cauſe to remove him. 12 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 27.</p>
               <p>4. Theſe Officers alſo may by the very <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Numb. </seg>6</label> Common Law, to enable themſelves for the <note place="margin">In making and levying of Rates.</note> execution of their Office in the Particulars aforeſaid, may ſet Rates and Taxes upon the
<pb facs="tcp:47585:78"/> Pariſhioners for the payment of money. And as touching this point, and to ſhew how the law is at this day upon the new Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, theſe things are to be known. 1. Theſe Officers with the Over-ſeers of the Poor of the Pariſh, or the greater part of them together, muſt now make theſe Rates; for if they be otherwiſe made, there is no means to recover them. 2. Theſe Rates may be made before there be preſent need, as before the Church fall, or be in danger of ruine, or the like. 3. Theſe Officers may by theſe Rates raiſe money for the buying of Books, providing of Bread and Wine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of the Church-yard or Burying place; for the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> and <hi>Marſhalſey,</hi> and other Payments. And ſo alſo, as it ſeems, for the repair of the Church, the Tower, and the Bells. 4. For this, they may rate <note place="margin">In making Rates.</note> every Inhabitant and Occupier of Lands, Tythes, Impropriate Woods, or other Hereditaments within the Pariſh. 5. The Church-wardens muſt give publick notice in the Church, when and where the Rate is to be made. Howbeit, if the Pariſhioners af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch notice given, will not come, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will not agree to the Rate; in this caſe the Church-wardens and Over-ſeers of the Poor alone, or the major part of them, may make the Rate: But a Rate made now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving notice thereof before hand to the Pariſh, is not good. 6. This Rate muſt be equall, and for this cauſe, It muſt be upon every Pariſhioner, and not upon ſome of the Pariſhioners only; and it muſt be ſet upon
<pb facs="tcp:47585:78"/> every one of them equally, <hi>(viz.)</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the quantity and quality of his Eſtate and Lands within the Pariſh, wherein they may rate by the Yard, Acre, or otherwiſe, as they think fit; ſo as it be equall and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true value, by an equall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. And if one of another Pariſh have Lands in the Pariſh where the Rate is made, in his own occupation; in this caſe they may rate him to Church Payments, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the value of his Land. And this, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit there be no houſe upon it, and albeit the Owner and Occupier dwell in another Pariſh; for as to this purpoſe he ſhall be called a Pariſhioner; and therefore he may, <note place="margin">Pariſhioner.</note> if he pleaſe, come unto, and frequent the Church of that Pariſh, as he doth the Church of the Pariſh wherein he lives. And where the Land-lord and Tenant both doe live out of the Pariſh, it ſeems, the Curch-wardens may rate either of them at their Election. And yet ſome hold, that in theſe and ſuch like caſes, the Rate muſt be alwayes ſet upon the Occupier of the Land, and not upon the Land-lord. And if the Farmer or Occupier of the Land doe live within the Pariſh, where the Rate is made, there he onely, and not the Land-lord, ſhall be rated; and the Tenant is to be rated for the whole value of the Land; and therefore the Land-lord is not to be rated again for the Rent he doth receive out of the Land; for then the Land would be twice rated: And in this caſe there is a Pariſhioner and Inhabitant charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And Receipt of Rent out of a Pariſh
<pb facs="tcp:47585:79"/> for Land within the Pariſh, by a man that lives in another Pariſh, will not make him a Pariſhioner. But if he have Land in the Pariſh in his own occupation; there he may be rated with this difference, he may be rated towards the repire of the Church only. For as to the repaire of the Seats of the Church providing of Church Ornaments, Sextons wages, and the like, he ſhall not be charged therewith, <hi>Browal.</hi> 2. <hi>part</hi> 10. And yet, in caſe where the Land-lord and Tenant both live within the Pariſh where the Rate is made, there the Raters may ſet the Rate upon which of them they pleaſe; yet ſo as they be not both rated for the ſame thing: but a man that doth neither dwell within the Pariſh, nor hath any Land within the Pariſh, cannot be rated at all towards the Church Payments. And therefore, if a Butcher come thither, it being a Market Town, to ſell Meat, and have a fixed Stall there; this will not make him a Pariſhioner, nor chargeable to the Church. 7. After the Rate is thus made by the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Numb. </seg>7</label> Church-wardens and Over-ſeers of the poor, it muſt be put in writing, and the Hands of the Church-wardens and Over-ſeers of the poor, and of the Pariſhioners that are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, it will be good to have annexed to it. But this is not neceſſary; for a Rate may be good without any Hands ſubſcribed, if it be duely made. 8. the Rate thus made by them, muſt be confirmed by the two next Juſtices of Peace. 9. If any one refuſe to pay them, being thus made, upon demande, the preſent or ſubſequent Church-wardens,
<pb facs="tcp:47585:79"/> may by Warrant under the Hands and Seals of the two next Juſtices of Peace, levy them, and all the arrears thereof; and two ſhillings ſix pence for the neglect upon the Goods of the party appointed to pay it. 10. If any be <note place="margin">Over-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ate.</note> grieved with the Rate, relief is to be had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Juſtices of Peace, at their Quarter Seſſions. Or if the Rate be read by practiſe and conſpiracy to oppreſs a man, as for Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, or to pay a debt, and in caſes where the Church-wardens or Over-ſeers have no Power, there perhaps they may make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves liable to an Action of the Caſe or Action of Treſpaſs.</p>
               <p>5. Theſe Officers are to relieve, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Rents of Lands or Annuities, given towards repair of Churches and Church duties according to the intent of the <hi>Donor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. The next thing theſe Officers by the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Numb. </seg>8</label> Common Law, are bound to doe, is, When <note place="margin">In delivering over the Church goods, and making an Accompt.</note> they are going out of their Office, they are truly to deliver up to the Pariſhioners, whatſoever Money or other things of right, belonging to the Church or Pariſh, they have in their hands; and it is the beſt way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them by Bill indented to the ſucceeding Church-wardens.</p>
               <p>7. The laſt thing theſe Officers are bound by the Common Law to doe, is, to give up a true and perfect Accompt of all their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts and Disburſements in the time of their Office: The which, it is beſt to doe to the ſucceeding Church-wardens. And this if theſe Officers refuſe to doe, their ſucceeding
<pb facs="tcp:47585:80"/> Church-wardens may now compell them to by an Action of Accompt at the Common Law. But now by the new Ordinance, they are bound within four dayes of their Office ended, and new Church-wardens choſen, to give an Accompt to their Succeſſors and the two next Juſtices of Peace, and to pay over the Money, in their hands, to their Succeſſors. And refuſiing this, they are to be committed without Bail, till they doe Accompt, and pay the Moneys in their hands. And by this Writ of Accompt, at the Common Law, the preſent Church-wardens may compel their Predeceſſors to give an Accompt of, and to anſwer for their doings, during the time of their Office: And if they have done the Pariſh any wrong, to make amends and ſatisfaction for the ſame, to the uſe of the Pariſh, for the harm it hath received by their default. And in this Accompt, the old Officers ſhall have <note place="margin">Allowances.</note> allowances for all the needfull ſums of Money laid out, or ſpent by them, either upon the Reparations of the body of the Church, Tower, or Bells; or for relief of the Priſoners in the Gaol, or otherwiſe where the Law doth enjoyn them to pay or disburſe them.</p>
               <p>And now having diſpatcht the Duty and Power of theſe Officers, commanded, and given to them, eſpecially by the ancient Common Law; we come to ſee wherein their Office is enlarged by ſome Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And this we ſhall finde to be in theſe particulars following.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Numb. </seg>2</label> of theſe Officers, theſe things are to be <note place="margin">Their Office and Duty.</note> known. 1. Some things they are to doe in their Office; they are to doe it, and may doe it <hi>Ex Officio,</hi> without any Warrant from any other. And ſome things they may doe only by Warrant from others: And ſome of theſe things concern the Poor: And ſome of them doe concern other matters. As to the firſt of theſe, we are to know theſe things. 1. That in this Office, the Church-Wardens of the place have an equall Authority and Charge with the Overſeers of the Poor; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, howſoever it be the common courſe in moſt places, for the Church-wardens to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it altogether, and not to meddle at all with it; yet it is a common neglect puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon the Church-wardens, and fit to be redreſſed. But if there be but one Church-warden within the Pariſh, this doth ſuffice; and the Overſeers of the Poor, and this Church-warden together, may execute the Office well enough. 2. The major part of them, without the reſt, may doe any thing belonging to their Office. 3. They muſt have the conſent of two Juſtices of the Peace (one of which muſt be of the <hi>Quorum)</hi> either in general or in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, to every thing they doe in their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: And yet, it ſeems, they may ſet up and uſe a Trade, by the conſent of one Juſtice of Peace, where there are not two Juſtices within the limits; Nor is this conſent other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe neceſſary, then as herein is after ſet forth.</p>
               <p>4. The Office of theſe Men lyeth in theſe <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Numb. </seg>3</label>
                  <pb facs="tcp:47585:84"/> things. 1. In general: They are to take <note place="margin">In ſetting the Poor on work.</note> order with the conſent of two Juſtices of Peace, one of the <hi>Quorum)</hi> to ſet their Poor awork, and if need be, for that purpoſe, to ſet up a Trade, place out their Apprentices, relieve the impotent, and ſuch as cannot work, or cannot live by their work. But more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, 2. They, with the conſent of two or more Juſtices, may ſet up and uſe any Trade, only for the ſetting awork and relief of the Poor of their own Pariſh, without breach of any Statute. 3. They are to ſet to work the Children of ſuch, whoſe Parents ſhall not, by them, be thought able to keep and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Children, and ſuch perſons, married and unmarried, as, having no means to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themſelves, uſe no ordinary and dayly Trade of life to get their living by; all thoſe that cannot get work elſwhere: And if any perſon ſo appointed by them to work, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe ſo to doe, or any others that are able, if they refuſe to work for the wages aſſeſſed, he may be ſent by any Juſtice of Peace to the common Gaole, or Houſe of Correction; not to their place of birth or laſt dwelling.</p>
               <p>2. The more part of them, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Numb. </seg>4</label> of the Juſtices as aforeſaid, may and <note place="margin">In binding Apprentices.</note> ought to binde forth and place to be Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices the Children of ſuch, whoſe Parents they judge unable to maintain their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; But they may not binde any other mens Children ſo: And they unto whom they are ſo bound, may, and muſt recive them, and keep them as Apprentices: In
<pb facs="tcp:47585:85"/> which particular, theſe things are to be known. 1. Two Juſtices muſt be agreeing to what they doe herein. 2. So they doe binde them to Weavers, Maſons, or any ſuch like Trade; or they may binde them to Husbandry or Houſwifery. 3. It is ſaid they may binde any above ſeven, and under Thirteen years: And the Man-Childe may be bound until he be of the age of twenty four years, and the Woman-Childe untill ſhe come to the age of one and twenty years, or be marryed. 4. Theſe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers may, with the Juſtice of Peace, help to compell any man within the Pariſh, that they think fit, to take ſuch a poor Childe to be his Apprentice, and that without any money at all, howbeit in this caſe it is meet that ſome reſpect be had; for if the Childe be yong, and the party to whom they would place it be not very able, they may give him money if they will; and it is fit that ſome money be given, as the Overſeers and the party can agree. And if they cannot agree, as the next Juſtices of Peace, or the Juſtices of Peace at the Seſſions ſhall ſet down. <hi>And this hath been the Reſolution of the Judges.</hi> 5. All men that have, or may have uſe for Servants, are bound to receive ſuch Apprentices them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or contribute towards the placing of them with others. And albeit a man be not a Tradeſman, but a Knight, Gentleman, Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-man, or Yeoman; and albeit he doe not keep Houſe, but be a Sojourner, if he uſe Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, Cloathing, Graſing, or the like: or howſoever his caſe be, if by his Calling and Profeſſion, he muſt entertain and uſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb facs="tcp:47585:85"/> of like quality; he may be compelled to take ſuch an Apprentice. Reſolved by the Judges. 6. If a wealthy man live ſo private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he heep few or no Servants, and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſuch a life, that he hath no need of ſuch a Servant; yet he may be compelled to take ſuch an Apprentice himſelf, or to give money towards the placing him with ſome other. And this notwithſtanding, they muſt bear their ordinary Rates to the Poor, as other men doe. <note place="margin">Rates.</note> Reſolved by the Judges. 7. If there be not Maſters enough within the ſame Pariſh, to entertain the poor Children there, the Juſtices of Peace may compell men of other Pariſhes within the ſame Hundred to take them: And if there be not enough within the Hundred, the Juſtices of the Peace, at their Seſſions, may compell them of any other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, within the County, to take them. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by the Judges. 8. Theſe Apprenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be bound to a man, either in regard of his ability, or in regard of his Farm. And in the laſt caſe it ſeems reaſonable that he goe with the Farm. 9. This binding muſt be <note place="margin">Indenture</note> by Indenture, or it is not good. 10. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentures thus made by the Church-wardens and Overſeers of the Poor, with the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Juſtices; and this binding by them, are as effectuall to all purpoſes, as if the Children were of full age and did binde themſelves by Indentures. 11. All ſuch as are ſo bound, according to 43 <hi>Eliz.</hi> may be ſafely received as Apprentices, 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 4. If any man refuſe to accept of an Apprentice being thus placed to him, he is by the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:47585:86"/> of Peace, to be bound to appear at the next Seſſions or Gaole-delivery: And if he refuſe ſo doe, he is to be ſent to the Gaole, till he doe ſo. And if he be bound to appear at the Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and doe appear, and then refuſe (without a ſufficient excuſe to be allowed of the Juſtices of Peace) he is by them to be bound to the good behaviour; or if he refuſe ſo to doe, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned till he doe ſo; and he may alſo be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted and Fined for his contempt. Reſolved by the Judges. 13. If a ſpecial Rate be ſet on any man to help place a poor Childe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice, it may be levyed upon his Goods as other Rates are levyed. Reſolved by the Judges. 14. If the Parents of ſuch poor Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, refuſe to let their Children go to be Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices, or intice them away, being bound; the Parents themſelves may be ſent to the houſe of Correction.</p>
               <p>3. The next main part of their Office is, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Numb. </seg>5</label> to give relief to, provide houſes for, and to <note place="margin">In relieving the Poor. And what Poor they are to relieve.</note> help them that are poor, and not able to live by their work: For this we muſt know, that there are three ſorts of Poor: 1. Such as are poor by impotency; as firſt, the aged decrepit perſons, that are paſt labor; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Infant Fatherleſs and Motherleſs, not able to work; Thirdly, the perſon naturally diſabled in Wit or Member, as the Ideot, Lunatick, Blinde, Lame, &amp;c. Fourthly, the perſon viſited with ſickneſs, who thereby, for the time is impotent. All theſe being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, and not able to Work, are to be found and provided for, by the Overſeers, or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary relief.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47585:86"/>
               <p> 2. Such as are ſo by Caſualty; as firſt, he that is caſually maimed in his Calling, as the Souldier, Laborer, &amp;c. Secondly, the perſon that is decayed by Fire, Water, Robbery, Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>etiſhip, &amp;c. Thirdly, the poor man over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with Children. All theſe, and ſuch like, having no ſufficient means to maintain themſelves, are to be holpen and ſet on work by the Overſeers; and being not able to live by their work, are further in Charity to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in ſome reaſonable proportion, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their wants.</p>
               <p>3. The thriftleſs Poor; as firſt, the riotous and prodigal perſon that ſpendeth at play, drinking, &amp;c. Secondly, the diſſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as Strumpet, pilferer, &amp;c. Thirdly, the ſloathfull perſon, that doth refuſe to work, or doth wilfully ſpoyl or imbezle his work. Fourthly, the Vagabond that will abide in no ſervice or place. Fifthly, ſuch as will work but for the wages taxed or uſually given And for all theſe latter ſort, the Houſe of Correction or Common Gaole is the fitteſt place; and to the Houſe of Correction is he to be ſent, and not to his place of Birth, that will not work at the wages aſſeſſed or uſually given: but if they have able bodies, they are to be compelled to labor; for the Rule of Chriſt is, That ſuch as will not labor, muſt not eat, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 10 And yet if theſe prove unable to work, then it ſeems they muſt have reliefe from the Pariſh as well as others.</p>
               <p>2. They are not to take care for houſes or other relief, for ſuch as are able to work,
<pb facs="tcp:47585:87"/> and have, or may have work, nor yet for their Children; for they are by their work to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them alſo: But if ſuch be over-burthened with Children, it will be good for the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers to place ſome of their Children Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices: and if theſe cannot have work, the Overſeers muſt procure them work; for none may beg in the High-wayes within or without their own Pariſh, nor at any mans dores with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Pariſh, by any licenſe whatſoever, nor at any mans dore within the Pariſh, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out order of the Overſeers of the Poor. 3. Nor are they to take care of ſuch as are able to live; and therefore if any ſuch perſon travel through a Pariſh with Children, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dye and leave them; in this caſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh is not bound, but in Charity, to relieve them. 4. Nor for ſuch as, having nothing to live by, have able bodies, may have work and will not work: They are not to take care to relieve Rogues, for they are to be ſent away.</p>
               <p>6. They muſt take care for ſuch Poor as <label type="milestone">

For the Juſtices of the Peace, at their general Seſſions, may rate the Father or Grand-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Mother or Grand-mother, Children or Grand-Children, being able to help relieve any poor People, and force them to pay it, if they live within the County. And yet if a Woman, having a Baſtard take a Husband, it ſeems he is not bound to keep the Baſtard, unleſs he have an Eſtate by
<pb facs="tcp:47585:87"/> her. And if the place be not able to relieve their Poor, two Juſtices, <hi>Quorum unus,</hi> may charge any other place within the Hundred to help: And if the Hundred be not able, the Quarter-Seſſions may charge the whole County.</p>
               <p>7. They muſt take care for all ſuch as are lawfully ſent to, and ſettled amongſt them, if they prove impotent. But by the way, as to the point of ſettling theſe Rules and Caſes following, are to be known.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He that is a Native, Houſholder, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorner, Apprentice, or Servant, within a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and doth live there in Peace but three weeks or a moneth together, is ſaid to be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled there: But he that paſſeth through a Town only, or is in another Mans Houſe, as an Inmate two or three dayes together; or lyeth in an out-Houſe or Barn, for a longer time, having no houſe to dwell in; or a Childe at Nurſe there; or a Scholar at School there; or in the place being an Uuniverſity; or as a Traveller in an Inne there, is not ſaid to be ſetled there by this. And therefore if any impotency happen to any ſuch, the place ſhall not be charged, but they ſhall be ſent to the place where they or their Parents are ſetled, or where the Children were ſetled. Reſolved of the Judges.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If a perſon be once duly ſettled in a Pariſh, he may not be after removed, but there he muſt be relieved, or ſet awork, as his caſe is; for no man is to be put out of the Town where he dwelleth, nor to be ſent to his place of Birth or laſt habitation, but a
<pb facs="tcp:47585:88"/> vagarant Rogue; And therefore they that have Houſes or Services in Pariſhes, when their Eſtates or Services are ended, are to get new Houſes or Services, and work if they be able: for in this caſe the Pariſh is not to provide for them: But if they be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, they muſt be there relieved, for they may not (in theſe caſes) be ſent to their places of birth, or laſt dwelling. And yet it is ſaid in theſe caſes, if any of theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhall be taken begging abroad out of the ſame Pariſh, that in this caſe ſuch perſon may be ſent from the place where they are taken begging, as a Vagabond to the place of his birth. Reſolved of the Judges. But if he goe of his own accord into that Pariſh, and doe not beg there, they cannot ſend him back; for none but a Rogue can be ſent back to any place from whence he came. <hi>Paſch.</hi> 7. <hi>Car. B. R. per Ch. Just.</hi> And thoſe yong Children whoſe Parents are dead, are to be ſet a work, relieved or maintained at the charge of the place where they are dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the time of the death of their Parents, and are not to be ſent to their place of Birth, &amp;c. For if the Parents be not Rogues, the Children cannot be Rogues till they wander and beg.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For further opening this matter, take theſe Rules. Firſt, the Law unſettleth none who are lawfully ſettled. Secondly, none may be ſettled by practiſe. Thirdly, none can be ſaid to be ſettled in that place where he is in no quiet, but continually interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by complaints to Juſtices of Peace, their
<pb facs="tcp:47585:88"/> warrants or other diſturbances of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners, or Over-ſeers of the Poor. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, no ſettlement can be made by compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and agreement. Fifthly, no ſettlement can be made by an illegal remove. Sixthly, nor can any ſettlement be by any mans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Pariſh obſcurely, and in a skulking way, that the Pariſh cannot take notice of him</p>
               <p n="4">4. For the opening and illuſtrating of theſe Rules, take theſe Examples and Caſes. 1. If a Rogue be taken at <hi>A.</hi> and he will not confeſs, nor can they finde the place of his Birth, but he ſaith that his laſt habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was at <hi>B.</hi> whereupon he is whipped ſent to <hi>B.</hi> and there he confeſſeth the place of his Birth to be at <hi>C.</hi> In this caſe, without any new vagarancy, they of <hi>B.</hi> may ſend him to <hi>C.</hi> Reſolved of the Judges. Secondly, If one that hath a Family, take a houſe in a Pariſh for one year, and before the end of the year, he is forced out of the poſſeſſion of it, and then goeth into another Pariſh and take part of a houſe, and is there as an Inmate but one, two, or three dayes, he is put out from thence; and then for want of a houſe lieth in a Barn in a third Pariſh, and there the Husband is ſick, and Wife delivered of a Child: Now in this caſe they ſhall be ſent to, and ſettled in the firſt Pariſh, where his houſe is, and from whence he was lawfully removed; for none may be ſo forced to turn Vagarants. Reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Judges. Thirdly, a Souldier maimed in the late Wars before <hi>May,</hi> one
<pb facs="tcp:47585:89"/> thouſand ſix hundred fourty ſeven, muſt be ſettled in the place where he was ſettled when he took up Arms. <hi>Ord. May</hi> one thouſand ſix hundred fourty ſeven. Fourthly, If an Apprentice or a Servant goe out of that condition, he cannot be thruſt out of the place, but muſt continue there, and be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of as his caſe requires. And if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of an Apprentice die before, or within the time, his Executors or Adminiſtrators muſt provide for him (if they be able) otherwiſe; and how<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Reſolved of the Judges. Fifthly, The Wife regularly is to goe with the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, albeit he be a Servant. Reſolved of the Judges. And if a Husband and Wife be Roguing, and they have a houſe in another Pariſh, though as an Inmate, they may be ſent thither. Reſolved of the Judges. And generall Children Seven years old, and vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, muſt be ſent to and ſettled with the Father or Mother, or Mothers Husband; and if he be dead, the Mother where ſhe was born or laſt dwelt the ſpace of a year. And being thus ſettled, they muſt there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, and not be ſent away from thence to their place of birth; though after their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb facs="tcp:47585:89"/> die or run away, or the Children be above Seven years old, or doe turn vagarant in that Town; for they muſt be there ſet on work. Reſolved of the Judges. If a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man have a Baſtard, and then take a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; it is ſaid he is not bound to maintain this Childe, unleſs he have a ſufficient Eſtate by his Wife to doe it, 10. <hi>Car.</hi> So held by the Seſſions in the County of <hi>Wilts.</hi> And if a Rogue, whoſe laſt place, or place of birth cannot be known, have a Wife, and Children under ſeven years old, they muſt goe with the Husband to the place, through which they were laſt wilfully ſuffered to paſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out puniſhment, where the Children are to be maintained by their Fathers work, though they be ſent to the Houſe of Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. <hi>Dalt. J. P.</hi> 14. If one hire a Houſe in <hi>A.</hi> or have no Houſe in <hi>A.</hi> and live there with his Wife and Children, and binde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſerve one in <hi>B.</hi> In this caſe, the Wife and Children muſt remain in <hi>A.</hi> But if he hire a Houſe in <hi>B.</hi> then they muſt be all in <hi>B.</hi> And Children, whoſe Parents are dead, are not to be ſent to their place of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>irth, &amp;c. If they be like to be a charge; for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents not being Rogues, the Children cannot be Rogues, unleſs they wander or beg: in this caſe therefore they muſt be maintained at the charge of the Pariſh where the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dyed. But if a travelling woman that hath a Childe ſucking on her, be ſent to Gaol and then hanged for Fellony, the Child ſhall not be charged on the Pariſh where ſhe is hanged; but it ſhall be ſent to, and ſettled
<pb facs="tcp:47585:90"/> in the place where ſhe was born, if it can be found, otherwiſe to the place where ſhe was taken.</p>
               <p>The Baſtard Childe, the Mother, or repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Father, being not able to maintain it, muſt be with the Mother ſo long as it is in the condition of a nurſing Child, and then it muſt be ſent to the place of its birth: And if one be delivered of a Baſtard Childe in one Pariſh, and after the Mother goe into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pariſh with it, or become vagarant, ſo that ſhe is ſent to the place of her birth; the Childe being under ſeven years of age, is to be ſent to the place of his birth, and not ſettled with the Mother. Reſolved of the Judges.</p>
               <p>If a Woman ſettled in a Service, hap to be with Childe, which is like to be a charge, the reputed Father being gone or poor, the Pariſh where ſhe is muſt be charged; but if ſhe be in another Pariſh and ſettled, there ſhe muſt continue. Reſolved of the Judges. And therefore if a Woman unmarried be hired Weekly, Half-yearly, or Yearly, in one Pariſh, and there is begotten with Childe; and then goeth into another Pariſh, where ſhe is ſettled in ſervice or otherwiſe, two or three moneths; and then ſhe appear to be with Childe, and it is like to be charge to the Pariſh, the reputed Father being gone or poor; in this caſe ſhe is to be ſettled in the Pariſh where ſhe is not, where ſhe was begot with Childe. Reſolved of the Judges. And if ſuch a Servant be got with Childe, and then goe or be legally put out of her
<pb facs="tcp:47585:90"/> Maſters ſervice, the Pariſh, not the Maſter, muſt be charged with it. Reſolved of the Judges. So if a Servant be with Child when ſhe is retained, and for this ſhe is afterwards by a Juſtice of Peace diſcharged of the ſervice within the time, or ſhe be with Childe and her time be expired, and ſhe not able; the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, not the Maſter, ſhall be charged herewith. Reſolved of the Judges.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Juſtices of the Peace in their Quarter Seſſions, if any queſtion be about theſe things, doe ſettle it according to theſe Rules.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Such as doe remove any contrary to theſe Rules, may be fined; and if any be ſent to any place againſt theſe Rules, they are to be ſent back again to the place from whence they came. <hi>Stat.</hi> 43 <hi>Eliz.</hi>

               <p>Theſe Officers muſt provide houſes as well as victuals for their Poor, and therefore they may by order of the Quarter Seſſions, and leave of the Lord of the Mannor, firſt had in writing under his Hand and Seal, build any houſe for the impotent Poor of the Pariſh in any waſte part of the Mannor, and they may place more Families than one therein, as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, without any danger: but then this houſe muſt not be afterwards converted into any other uſe; for ſo it may become a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage afterwards.</p>

For to this purpoſe, it is provided, that the Church-wardens and Over-ſeers of the poor, or the greater part of them, with the aſſent of two Juſtices of the Peace, may raiſe weekly or otherwiſe (by Taxation of every Inhabitant, Parſon, Vicar, and other, and of every Occupier of Lands, Houſes, Tythes impropriate, or propriation of Tythes, Coal-mines, or ſaleable Uunderwoods in the ſaid Pariſh, in ſuch competent ſum and ſums of money as they ſhall think fit) a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient ſtock of Flax, Hemp, Wool, Thread, Iron, and other neceſſary Stuff to ſet the poor on work: and alſo competent ſums of money, for and towards the neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Lame, Impotent, Old, Blind, and ſuch other among them being poor and not able to work: And alſo for the putting out of the Children of poor perſons to be Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices: And alſo for the ſetting up of houſes for the Poor, to be gathered out of the ſame Pariſh, according to the ability of the ſame Pariſh, and they may doe and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute all other things, as well for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the ſaid Stock, or otherwiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the premiſes as to them ſhall ſeem convenient.

For in <hi>Hill.</hi> Term. 10. <hi>Car. inter Nichols</hi> and <hi>Walker,</hi> was this caſe in the <hi>Kings Bench. Totrige</hi> was time out of minde, within the Pariſh and parcel of the Pariſh of <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> in the County of <hi>Hertford;</hi> and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Hatfield,</hi> had time out of minde, had all the Tithes out of <hi>Totridge,</hi> as within the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of <hi>Hatfield,</hi> and had alwayes placed Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates there to ſay Divine ſervice in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of <hi>Totridge;</hi> and that for ſixty years before <hi>Totridge</hi> was reputed a pariſh of it ſelf, and during that time, had parochiall Officers; and that of late the Over-ſeers of the poor for the Pariſh of <hi>Hatfield,</hi> had taxed the Plaintiff <hi>Nichols</hi> (being an Inhabitant of <hi>Totridge)</hi> to pay to the poor of <hi>Hatfield,</hi> which tax was confirmed by the Juſtice; and the money being unpaid, the Defendant <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> being an Over-ſeer by Warrant from the Juſtices of Peace, diſtrained the Plaintiffs Goods; and for this taking of his Goods <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chols</hi> brought an Action againſt <hi>Walker,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:47585:92"/> in this caſe it was adjudged for the Plantif, and Reſolved by the Judges, that <hi>Totridge</hi> being but a Pariſh in reputation only, ſhould not be liable to the Taxation made by the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers of the Poor of <hi>Hatfield.</hi> 3. Every man muſt be rated for his Land to all Rates accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the quality and yearly value, and not according to the quantity thereof. And ſo was the opinion of the Lord Chief Juſtice, and Baron <hi>Denham,</hi> at an Aſſiſes at <hi>Sarum.</hi> 8. <hi>Car.</hi> 4. He that doth occupy Land in his own hands, lying in ſeverall Pariſhes, muſt be charged in every Pariſh for his Land there, only proportionably and no more. 5. The Farmer is to be rated for the Lands he hath in Leaſe, not the Leſſor. 6. The Lord or Leſſor ſhall not be charged for the Rent iſſuing out of the Land, becauſe the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is chargeable for the whole Land. 7. If there be ſome other Lands within the Pariſh that be ancient Demeſn, and ſome that be Guildable, it ſeems they muſt be all rated, and ſo alſo of Copyhold Lands. 8. Impropriations (by the very Letter of the Statute) are to be rated to the Poor as well as other Lands. And in the rating of them, it ſeems reaſonable, that where they have the Tenth of the whole Pariſh, they bear the Tenth of the charge of the Rate to the Poor. And ſo hath it been of late Reſolved by the Judges. 9. Saleable Underwoods (by the expreſs Letter of the Statute are rateable, and by theſe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended generally, all Woods for Fire-wood, albeit they be not cut in thirty or fourty
<pb facs="tcp:47585:92"/> years (as the Beech-wood of many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries is uſed to be cut) for it ſeems there is no wood to be exempted from this Rate but Timber-wood onely: Alſo Coal-mines are chargeable to this Rate, and for theſe things they muſt be proportioned to a year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly benefit. So that if a man have a hundred Acres of wood within the Pariſh, it muſt be conſidered what wood he may ſell, and what benefit he may make thereof yearly, to the Worlds end; and according to the ſame the Rate muſt be made: And for Coal-mines it muſt be conſidered what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit a man doth make by them, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſame, he muſt be rated. 10. Parſons, Vicars, and ſuch like perſons (as Inhabitan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s) within the intent of this Statute, are to be rated towards the relief of the Poor as well as other men; and ſo hath it been Reſolved of late by the Judges. 11. Any man that dwelleth within the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, albeit he have no Land within the Pariſh, may be rated towards the relief of the Poor of the Pariſh. And ſo hath it been alſo Reſolved by the Judges. 12. In ſome caſes a man may be taxed for his Goods, as well as for his Lands; and in caſe of a Rate for the Poor, men may be taxed for their viſible Eſtate of goods, <hi>viz.</hi> their Oxen, Kine, Sheep, &amp;c. as well as for their Lands and not only for thoſe goods that are within the ſame Pariſh, where a man doth dwell, but alſo for thoſe goods which he hath in any other place: for a man ſhall not be rated for his goods in any place, but
<pb facs="tcp:47585:93"/> in the place where he doth dwell. Nay it is held in this caſe of Rating for the poor, ſome reſpect may be had to mens inviſible Eſtate of money; for the caſe may be ſo, that the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters may know a man within the pariſh that hath no other Eſtate, and yet perhaps hath an annuity of one hundred pounds by the year, or hath hundreds of thouſands of pounds of money owing to him; and in ſuch a clear and certain caſe, they may no doubt Rate him according to that value. 13. In ſome ſpecial caſe a man may be Rated beyond his ability: for if a Pariſhioner for his own gain, or otherwiſe, ſhall bring into the pariſh, without the conſent thereof, a Stranger who is, or is apparently like to be burthenſom to the pariſh, in this caſe the Pariſhioners (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have no other remedy againſt him) may Rate him, not only according to his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Lands and Goods, but according to the Damage he bringeth, or is like to bring to the Pariſh by his folly: For if any perſon ſhall finde himſelf grieved with any ſuch Rate to the Poor, or other ſuch like act done by the Overſeers of the Poor, or the Juſtices of the Peace, he hath no other remedy but to complain to the Juſtices of the Peace at the Quarter Seſſions, where (the caſe appearing to be as aforeſaid) he ſhall have a little relief. 14. If any man refuſe to pay his Rates for the poor, the preſent or ſubſequent Overſeers of the Poor ſhall have a Warrant from the Juſtices of the Peace to levy the ſame of the parties Goods; And thereupon they may and muſt ſell the parties Goods, and pay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb facs="tcp:47585:93"/> their Rate, and give the party the over-plus of the money if there be any; and if he have no Goods, then to carry him to Gaol, there to abide until he doe pay it. It ſeems to me, that for relief of the poor that they have not places for in caſe of neceſſity, that they may Rate the pariſh to build a houſe, and to buy a peece of ground in ſome of the Pariſhioners names to ſet it upon: For it is in their diſcretion which way to provide. And if they over-rate any man to theſe ends, they cannot be ſued by the party grieved: But if there be any conſpiracie in the caſe, to oppreſs a man, or he be rated to pay debts, or for Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, or for any other purpoſe by theſe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, an Action will lye againſt them.</p>
               <p>Theſe Officers, with the Church-wardens, the Parſon or Vicar, and the Conſtables of the place, or the moſt part of them (where any money is or ſhall be given, to be continually imployed for the binding out, as Apprentices, the pooreſt ſorts of Children) ſhall within the ſame places, have the nomination and placing of ſuch Apprentices, and the guiding and imployment of ſuch monies as have been heretofore ſo given, or which hereafter ſhall be ſo given to and for the continual binding forth of ſuch and ſo many Apprentices; and in ſuch ſort as is already or ſhall hereafter be ſo given and appointed, either by the laſt Will or any Writing under the Hand and Seal of the givers of ſuch monies. And if any of them wilfully forbear or refuſe, according to their duties, to imploy ſuch monies, by means whereof, the ſaid monie ſhall not be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

And if the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice, Maſter, &amp;c. happen to die within the ſaid ſeven years, then within one year next after ſuch death. And theſe Officers and the reſt ought to put forth and employ ſuch monies within three moneths at the furtheſt, after the ſame ſhall come to their hands. And if there ſhall not be found fit perſons to be bound out Apprentices in the Towns and Pariſhes where ſuch monies are or ſhall be given, to be employed as aforeſaid, the pooreſt Children of any of the Pariſhes next adjoyning may (by the diſcretion of the ſaid Parſon, Vicar, &amp;c.) be bound Apprentices, taking ſuch Bonds as are before mentioned.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Numb </seg>2</label> and the Law in this point; theſe things <note place="margin">Their Office and Duty.</note> are to be known.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they have to doe with no wayes, but the publick High-wayes. And ſo hath it been reſolved by the Judges in the Upper Bench: For the Statute is High-wayes lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Market Towns.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Conſtables and the Church war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of the Pariſh are at the time of choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of theſe Officers, to name and appoint ſix dayes, to be before the Nativity of Saint <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, then next following, ſet apart for the amending of the High-wayes; and they are to give notice thereof the next Sunday after in publick in the Church: And this being done, theſe Officers, <hi>viz.</hi> The Surveyors of the High-wayes are to ſee that the ſame be obſerved, and that all the Pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners doe their work on the ſame dayes in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as followeth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Every perſon having a Plough, Land in Tillage, or in Paſture, in the ſame Pariſh, or keeping there a Plough or a Daught, ſhall finde and ſend on every day to the place appointed, one Wain or Cart, provided after the faſhion of the Country, with Oxen, &amp;c. fit for the carriage, and with neceſſary
<pb facs="tcp:47585:99"/> Tools fit for the work, and with two able men; and then and there theſe men muſt doe ſuch work with their Plough, &amp;c. as they ſhall be appointed to doe by the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyors aforeſaid, by the ſpace of eight hours on every of the ſaid dayes, under pain to forfeit for every default ten ſhillings. And every other Houſholder, Cottager, and Laborer of the Pariſh (able to labor, and being no hired Servant by the year) muſt by himſelf, or ſome other able man, be then and there ready to work, and work every one of the ſaid ſix dayes by the ſpace of eight hours, as they ſhall be appointed by the ſaid Surveyors, under pain to forfeit twelve pence for every day they ſhall make default herein. In the Explication of which Branch, theſe things are to be known.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That a Plough land is not of any certain content, but ordinarily ſo much as one Plough may plough in one year; which in ſome Countries is more, in ſome leſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the heavineſs of the ſoyl. <hi>Cook.</hi> 4. 37. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. 124.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That ſo many Ploughs as men uſually have, and uſe in the Summer about their own buſineſs, ſo many they are to bring with them to this work: So that (for example) if a man with one Plough, and five or ſix horſes, ſhall plough ſeven or eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Acres of Errable Land, and ſhall uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally go in the Summer with two Carts or Draughts; in this caſe, it ſeems he is to come with two Carts or Draughts to this
<pb facs="tcp:47585:100"/> ſervice. And he that occupieth fourty or fifty Acres of Land, and keepeth only three Horſes, and one Draught or Cart, he is to come with one Draught or Cart.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If a man keep only two Horſes and a Cart for his own buſineſs; In this caſe it ſeems, he is to come with his Cart and two Horſes, provided with a man or men to manage them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He that hath a Plough-Land, and hath no Plough, but doth ſuffer his Land to lye freſh, yet is to finde and ſend a Plough to this work: And ſo it was agreed by the Judges in the Upper-Bench. <hi>Mich.</hi> 21 <hi>Jac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fthly, A Plough-Land may contain Houſe, Meadow, Paſture, and Wood; and therefore, if one have ſo much of this, as will keep a Plough, and yield Tillage for it, if part of it were Eared up: In this caſe, it ſeems, he is bound to ſend his Plough, or elſe to pay for the ſame the penalty appointed by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, for his neglect.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, He that keepeth a Plough or Draught for carriage albeit he occupieth little or no Land or Paſture, in his own hands; yet ſuch one, it ſeems, is bound by the Statute to ſend his Plough to this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, He that doth occupie a Plough Land lying in Tillage or Paſture, in ſeveral Pariſhes, ſhall be chargeable to the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the High-wayes in the Pariſh where he dwelleth, as far as any perſon having a Plough-Land in any one Pariſh is charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47585:100"/>
               <p> Eighthly, Every perſon keeping in his hands and poſſeſſion, ſeveral or divers Plough-Lands, ſhall be charged to finde in each Town or Pariſh where the Plough-Lands (being in his occupation) doe lye, one Cart, &amp;c. furniſhed for the reparation of the High-wayes in the ſeveral Pariſhes where his Land doth lye, as if he were a Pariſhioner dwelling in the Pariſh where the Plough-Land doth lye.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, If a man be chargeable but as a Cottager, yet if he be in the Subſidy five pounds in Goods, or fourty ſhillings in Lands; ſo long as he ſtands at that Rate, he is to ſend two able men to the work every one of the ſix dayes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the Surveyors ſhall think any of the Ploughs or Carts to be needleſs any of the dayes, they may ſpare them, and inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of require two able men; the which muſt come under pain to forfeit twelve pence a man for every default.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Theſe Officers muſt ſee that the work be done according to the direction of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes; and every man is to ſee that he doth his part therein. But if the Surveyors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhall licence any man to doe leſs then his work, this will excuſe him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Owners of the grounds adjoyning to the High-wayes, are to take care that all the Fences, Hedges, and Ditches, next ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning on either ſide of the ſame, be from time to time Dicked, Scoured, Repaired and kept low; and that all the Trees and Buſhes therein be cut down, under pain to
<pb facs="tcp:47585:101"/> loſe for every default ten ſhillings. And if any man hath any Ditch in his own Ground that doth ſerve to lead away the water out of the High-way, and he doth not ſcour and keep the ſame clean, ſo as to convey away the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; he ſhall forfeit for every Rood not ſo ſcoured 12 d. And if any man that hath a Ditch lying by the High-wayes ſide, doth caſt the ſame up into the High-way, and then ſuffer the ſame to lie there by the ſpace of ſix moneths, to the annoyance of the High-way, he ſhall forfeit for every Load ſo caſt up, twelve pence.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Theſe Officers may, if they ſee cauſe for the amendment of the High-ways, take and carry away ſo much of the Rubbiſh, and ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt broken Stones already digged of any mans Quarry lying within the ſame Pariſh, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leave of the owner, as they ſhall think needfull: But they may not without Licence dig in any mans Quarry for new Stones, much leſs take away any mans Stones already digged. And if there be no ſuch Rubbiſh to be found in any mans Quarry, within the ſaid Pariſh, then may they enter into any mans ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ground (within the Pariſh) lying neer the place where the wayes are decayed, and there, if they ſee hope of finding Materials fit for reparation thereof, may dig a new Quarry without any leave of the owner of the Grounds; or they may enter upon any mans Ground, and gather the Stones that lye diſperſed there: But they may not without leave dig for any new Quarry in the Houſe, Garden, Orchard, or Meadow of any man; nor (albeit it be in
<pb facs="tcp:47585:101"/> other Ground) dig more then one pit, and the ſame in bredth or length not above ten yards over at the moſt; and then alſo they muſt take care that the ſame be within one moneth after filled up again at the charge of the Pariſh, under pain to forfeit five Marks to the owner of the Ground. And if there be any Spring or Water in the High-way that doth annoy the High-way, they may turn the ſame out of the High-way into any mans Ditches, according to their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion.</p>
               <p n="8">8. They muſt within one moneth after any default is made in any of the particulars afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, preſent the ſame to the next Juſtice of Peace, under pain to forfeit fourty ſhillings for every neglect And this Preſentment that Juſtice of Peace muſt preſent to the next Quarter Seſſions, under pain of five pounds.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If any man offend againſt the Statute of 2 <hi>&amp;</hi> 3 <hi>Phil. &amp; Mary, (i.)

If all this labor appointed by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes to be beſtowed on the High-wayes, be not ſufficient for the amendment thereof, the Pariſh muſt ſupply it: For the Pariſhioners of every Pariſh are to look to their High-wayes, that they be well repaired and kept at their peril. For an Information or Indictment may be (by the very Common Law preferred for the Keepers of the Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c.) againſt the Inhabitants of a Pariſh for not repairing of their High-wayes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they may be fined to the Keepers of the Liberty, &amp;c. And in this caſe the Fine ſhall not goe to the uſe of the High-wayes, as the Forfeitures and Penalties for the breaches of the Statutes ſhall doe.</p>

                  </note> alſo are to be choſen: And if no ſuch choiſe be made of theſe new Officers this day, then the Overſeers of the Poor for that preſent time muſt be the Surveyors of the High-wayes
<pb facs="tcp:47585:103"/> alſo upon this new Law. Alſo Scavengers (where any are) or (as it ſeems) they may be made in any Pariſh as new Officers: And there they are to be Surveyors, &amp; have equall power with the Surveyors by this new Law. And now, at this day, by this we doe perceive that there are to be Supraviſors for the High-wayes, upon the former Laws, to overſee all the Work required to be done by them; which is to be continued and performed ſtill. And there are to be new Surveyors, by this new Law, to overſee the Work to be done thereby; and theſe are diſtinct Officers one from the other. And if theſe Officers execute their Offices faithfully but a while, their wayes will be ſo good, that there will be little to doe for either of them, for a long time after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>The men of the Pariſh choſen to this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, <note place="margin">What they may and must doe.</note> by this new Law, they are to ſee to theſe following things. 1. They muſt take upon <note place="margin">

They muſt repair and cleanſe, and keep repaired and cleanſed all the High-wayes, common Bridges, Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, Streets, and Pavements, belonging to the Pariſh. And in Cities and Towns cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate, all the Streets and Pavements therein, or the Suburbs thereof of neer adjoyning to the ſame. And in other places where Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Streets are, they are to look to them: And they are to reform com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Nuſances herein. They are alſo to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecure
<pb facs="tcp:47585:103"/> all ſuch as have ſtreightned the High-wayes by Hedges, Ditches, Walls, or the like, within twenty years paſt; and ſuch as doe not ſcour and dreſs their Hedges, Ditches, &amp;c. and ſuch as have any Pavements defective, or ſuffer any Nuſance by filth or otherwiſe. 3. They are for this purpoſe, within ten <note place="margin">Twenty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings forfeit, if neglected.</note> daies after they have taken their Oath, to view all the common and publick High-wayes, and Roades where Carts and Carriages uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſe, and conſider what is to be done, and what money to be raiſed to doe it. 4. They are, within ſix dayes after this view, to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in their Pariſh Church or Chappell; of a time and place of meeting, to be within three daies after, to meet to make a Rate to raiſe money to doe it. 5. At that time and place they, with their, or the greater part of their Neighbours preſent (if they can agree together) if not, by themſelves are to make a pound Rate in writing upon all the Occupiers of Houſes, Lands, Tythes, Cole-Mines, ſale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Woods, Tenements, and Heraditaments within the Pariſh; and upon all the dead Goods, Commodities, or Stock in Trade, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting twenty pounds therein, to be equall to twenty ſhillings a year in Land. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they may rate over and above all ſuch men as doe ſuffer any Nuſances in, or doe any hurt to the High-wayes: And ſo they may rate as oft as they pleaſe, ſo as they doe not exceed herein twelve pence in the pound for one year, 6. If theſe Officers and the reſt of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners preſent, cannot within two dayes of this meeting agree, then they themſelves
<pb facs="tcp:47585:104"/> may make it: And being made, they muſt get it to be confirmed by the hand of one Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Peace. And being thus made, it is become a perfect Rate, and not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered but by the Juſtices of the Peace in their Quarter Seſſions, or by two of the Juſtices then preſent at the Quarter Seſſions: And this Rate, if every man doth not pay it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſeven dayes after it is made, and after pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique notice is given for the payment of it, is to be doubled. 7. They are to hire Ploughs and Men, ſo many as they think fit: And the Men ſo hired muſt work, being required, for the wages that any two Juſtices of the Peace ſhall ſet down. 8. They may cauſe the Dytches adjoyning to High-wayes, or ſerving to lead the water from them, that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed or unſcoured, to be dreſſed and ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And for any water-courſe that doth run into or ſtand in any High-way to annoy it, they may ſtop it or turn it into any adjoyning Ditch; or they may make new Ditches in convenient places through the grounds ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning, for the conveyance thereof another way. And they may cut, plaſh, and keep low all the Trees, Buſhes and Hedges ſtanding in High-wayes, or that are ſuffered to grow up by them, to keep the ſtrength of the Sun from them. 9. They may dig and take Stones, Gravel, Sand, Cynder, Chalk, or any thing fit for the mending of the High-wayes in any common ground. And if none be to be found therein, or no ſuch Common there, then they may take it in any private mans Ground, Paſture, or Fallow in or neer the
<pb facs="tcp:47585:104"/> Pariſh. And they may take a convenient way to carry it through any mans ground at ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable times: but for this way, and for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls taken out of a private mans ground, they are to give to him reaſonable ſatisfaction ſuch as they can agree upon; and if they cannot agree upon it, then ſuch as any one Juſtice of Peace not intereſſed in the thing, and indifferently choſen between them ſhall ſet down. 10. If the Pariſh by the Rate of twelve pence in the pound in the whole year, cannot ſufficiently amend their High-wayes, the Surveyors may by the help of the Juſtices of the Peace get them help from other Pariſhes, that are under that Value in the whole year, untill their whole charge come up to this Rate. And if there be any thing gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <note place="margin">Charitable uſes.</note> towards the Repair of their High-wayes, which is not imployed or miſ-imployed, they are to ſeek to the Juſtices of Peace for relief herein. 11. Theſe Officers alſo may, and ſo may any Conſtable or other man within the Pariſh, take all the Horſes, Mares, and Oxen that are in Carts and Waggons loaden, drawn through the Pariſh, that are over and above five Horſes or Mares, or ſix Oxen and one Horſe in one Cart or Waggon. And <note place="margin">Supernutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarie Cattel in a Plough.</note> if the Owner doe not within ſeven dayes after the taking thereof, pay twenty ſhillings to the Pariſh wherein they were taken, for every Oxe Mare or Horſe, over and above the number aforeſaid, with the charge laid out about it, and for the keeping of it; then he may ſell the ſame and deduct ſo much of the money. But the overplus
<pb facs="tcp:47585:105"/> he muſt give back to the Owner. 12. If all this will not doe, to redreſs the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects <note place="margin">By-Laws.</note> of pavements and water-courſes, and to make them run freely; and for the removing of filth and other Nuſances in ſtreets, and other by places, the Inhabitants of the Pariſh may make by-Lawes for a ſpeciall Rate upon the Pariſh, and make ſpeciall Officers, and put penalties upon Offenders, and other things to doe it. And theſe Rates and penalties may be levyed by diſtreſs and ſale of the goods of the party, by warrant from any Juſtice of the Peace: and theſe By-lawes they may have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Juſtices of the Peace in their Quarter Seſſions. 13. They are to imploy and beſtow all the Rates, Penalties, Fines and forfeitures, ariſing by this new Ordinance, or by any other lawes touching High-wayes and Streets; and all Iſſues to be forfeit for not appearing to any Information or Indictment for not repairing of High-wayes, or not remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or reforming of Defects or Nuſances in Streets or High-wayes; and all Fines and Amercements to be ſet upon any place or perſon for not repairing High-wayes, Streets, or Water-courſes, to pay for Workmen and Ploughs, and to doe other things to be done by this Ordinance. 14. Thoſe Rates and <note place="margin">Diſtreſs.</note> penalties theſe Surveyors, or any of them, may levy by diſtreſs and ſale of goods of the party, by a warrant from any one Juſtice of the Peace: and for lack of diſtreſs or not pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof within ten dayes after demand made or left in writing, under the hands of the Surveyors, or either of them at his houſe,
<pb facs="tcp:47585:105"/> who is to pay it, the party may, by warrant of the Juſtice, be committed to Gaol without Bail till he pay double the money to be paid, and the charges of proſecution for the recovery of it. 15. They are within a moneth of the <note place="margin">Account.</note> end of the year in their Office, to give in to the Pariſh at ſome meeting, to be by them appointed, a juſt and perfect Account of all the money by them recived, and laid out, in the time of their Office; and they are to pay over the money then remaining in their hands to their Succeſſors. And herein they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the money they have laid out in the proſecution of ſuch as doe any Nuſance in the High-way; and upon his neglect or refuſall that is a Surveyor, any Juſtice of Peace may commit him to Gaol without Bail, till he make ſuch Account and payment, and ſuch ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the Pariſh for the wrong, as any one Juſtice of the Peace ſhall ſet down. 16. And if any of theſe Officers, or any other, be ſued for any thing done in theſe things, the Action muſt be laid in the County where it was done, he may plead to it the generall Iſſue: and if the caſe appear ſo, the Jury muſt fine for the Defendant; and then, or if the Plantif be non-ſuit, or diſcontinue his Action, the Defendant ſhall have his full coſts he hath laid out, to be ſet down by his own oath, and ten pounds more to make him amends for his vexation, <hi>Ordinance of the Lord Protector and his Councell, March</hi> 31. 1654.</p>

He is to be choſen by the Pariſh, and approved and ſworn by a Juſtice of Peace, and the ſame entred upon the Regiſter book of the Pariſh: And then he is to continue three years in his Office and longer, till another be choſen; unleſs the Juſtice of Peace, or Juſtice of Peace and Pariſh together, put him out in the mean time.</p>
               <p>This Officer is to receive a note in writing <note place="margin">His Office and Duty.</note> from any one or both of his Pariſh, or one of

               <p>4. If any exception be made againſt the ſame intended marriage, he muſt inſert the ſame, with the name of the perſon making the exception, and his place of abode in the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate of publication.</p>
               <p>5. It were very convenient for him to be preſent at the Marriage; for he is to attend the Juſtice of Peace to ſubſcribe the entire of the Marriage.</p>
               <p>6. He is to call for, receive, and keep the old Church-Book; and to call for, of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, a new Regiſter parchment Book, which the Pariſh muſt provide, and he muſt keep; And therein he is fairly to enter in writing all the publication of Marriages, Marriages, Births of Children, and Burials of all ſorts of perſons, and the names of every of them, and the dayes of the moneth and year of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications, Marriages, Byrths, and Burials,
<pb facs="tcp:47585:107"/> and the Parents, Guardians, or Over-ſeers names. And for this his Fees are as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: For the publication and Certificate of a Marriage twelve pence; and for the entry of the Marriage, twelve pence: And for the entry of the Birth of a Child four pence; And for the entire of the death of any man four pence. And for all this, for poor People that live upon Almes, nothing: But by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of 3. <hi>Jan.</hi> 1644. it was ordained, That ſuch a Book ſhould be provided by every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and kept by the Miniſter and other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Church; and that therein the names of all Children and their Parents, the time of their Byrth and Baptiſm; and of all perſons Married, and the time of all Buried, and the time of their Birth and Burial be written and ſet down by the Miniſter there.
